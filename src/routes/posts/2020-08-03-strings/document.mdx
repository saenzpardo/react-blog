# Learning - There's not an easy way

I've read articles, books, blogs and posts discussing different aspects of programming.  I wasn't 
searching for a "quick" route...it just seemed the point was often brought up and it was often a 
selling point.  **Learn JAVA in 24 hours!!** Obviously you aren't going to learn JAVA in a day or a 
week.  That book was designed to provide 24 lessons, each an hour long.  It gave a crash course on 
syntax and gave examples of coding exercises you could follow along, but it was by no means meant 
to give you the skills to be proficient in a foreign language.  Other articles might contain
 some interesting methods or ideas, but let's face it, it's hard.  It's difficult to find practical
 material that you can put to use.  I remember finishing that book and still not having the 
 slightest idea where to begin.  I wanted to write a program!  Something useful that could change
 the world!!  I just really didn't know where to start.  Even if I did, a JAVA program by itself 
 is neat, but it's difficult to deploy.  To get something out there fast you need to deploy a web
 application of sorts.  Something that can be pulled up in a web browser, or deployed to a mobile
 app.  

 ## Web Applications

  I'll be honest.  I still don't know where to begin.  I know you need a hosting service.  I know
  there needs to be a means of communication between the client and server for many applications
