# The Beginning

Well not *technically* the beginning.  I've been playing with technology for years.  I don't want to date myself, but I remember 
playing **Oregon Trail** on 5" floppy.  I recall my 2nd grade teacher not understanding how to start the program and I would
get the machine loaded up and the game started.  I started learning a bit here and there about code.  Mostly out of curiousity
or to make a small change or modification to something.  I wanted to know how things worked and I wanted to make them work
differently.  I found myself in a career that was monotonous at the same time I was playing with Arduino devices.  I wanted to
create my own programs, but I lacked knowledge and didn't want to follow online tutorials everytime I wanted to make an LED 
light up.  I found my local community college was offering a class in C# and decided to give it a go!  That was my mistake...

### Curiouser and Curiouser

I was intrigued!  I feel like I'm not very good at coding.  I still find myself looking up the most rudimentary algorithms.  I attribute
that to my lack of ability to master any single language before moving onto another.  First there was C#, then Python, C# again, 
oh and now you need to take a class on Java...next semester is Intro to WebDev so you should learn some JavaScript (not needed,
but more interesting than HTML), wait what's React?? Angular!?! no...let's stick with react.  Angular looks like a bitch... but 
what about .NET?? Oh waint, I'm really going to need SQL! or maybe NoSQL...Use case isn't really clear at this point, so I'm not 
sure...You get the idea.  It's tough to just learn one language when you can't do much with just that language.  You need an 
entire briefcase full of tools to create anything of value it seems!  I have a very intelligent friend that codes for a living 
everyday.  I'll send him snippets of projects that I'm sure seem laughable and elementary, but he's a good friend and is always 
very clear and concise when responding to my questions.  If we lived closer together I'd make him my mentor.  But I'm at the mercy
of my local community college and online tutorials.  Oh and thank God for Indian YouTubers explaining every aspect of programming.

### It's Just Time 

**Time.** It's self-defeating.  I'm doing this to get experience to be able to have more flexibility and time to spend with my family.
Time spent here is time spent away from my wife.  Time away from my kids.  Time that could be used to become more
successful at my current position.  Although, I'm pretty sure I've reached peak salary aside from cost of living raises.  
*Disheartening...* Where is the motivation to excel and go the extra mile when you know there's nothing but a *"Good job out there
today!"*  
There isn't. I've reached maximum capacity.  My time is worth more than my reputation.  Time, time, time.  Every so often there's an 
evening when the girls are in good moods and my wife and I aren't exhausted.  My wife and I love those times.  We play games, or go 
on bike rides.  We go to the park, or do stuff and things.  I love doing stuff and things.  I wish there was more time for professional
development.  More time to enjoy family.  More time to travel and explore.  **Time, time, time.**  Until next time.
